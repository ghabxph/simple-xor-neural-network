# XOR Neural Network

Implemented in C++. This piece of code is very simple implementation of XOR, using neural network. I did this for personal study on neural network.

I'm a total newbie on this subject. I base everything from this website:
https://stevenmiller888.github.io/mind-how-to-build-a-neural-network/

So you might notice that every values here are somewhat similar. I'm experimenting and learning things.
